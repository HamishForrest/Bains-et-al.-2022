# Mice in all cages exhibit same relationship between fixed effects and value (fixed slope). We modelled sex, age and genotype as
# categorial fixed effects, as was the interaction of sex, age and genotype. Various other interactions, were
# omitted from the model as they did not contribute to model fit (further exaple of model selection later). To account for pseudoreplication,
# we modelled cage as a random intercept (different cages can have different baselines for activity). We determined that
# there was no significant overall effect of timepoint, however, a weak effect was apparent in some experimental groups.
# Therefore, we modelled timepoint as a random slope (values may differ or trend between experimental days).
# We modelled the timepoint slope on the cage intercept to allow the relationship between value and day of experiment to
# differ between cages.
